I wanted to let you know something that has been on my mind. 
The time we've spent together has meant a lot to me, 
and I've found myself developing feelings for you that go beyond friendship. 
I'm not sure if you feel the same way, 
and that's okay. 
Regardless of how you feel, 
I just wanted to be honest about how I feel. 
You're an amazing person, 
and I hope we can continue being a part of each other's lives.
